suggestions for improvement:
- In Exercise 3, the comments in `PetDog`'s methods (`train`, `play`, `do_a_trick`) should be replaced with actual implementations.  The code provided only has placeholders. 
- Exercise 3 could benefit from more robust error handling.  For instance, the `play` method doesn't handle the case where no dogs are provided. Consider adding a check and an appropriate message. 
- In Exercise 4,  the `check_majority` method could be improved by using a more concise search method (like list comprehension or `next()` with a default value) to find the person instead of iterating through the entire list. This enhances readability and potentially performance.
