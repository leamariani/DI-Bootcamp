Daniel Radcliffe as Harry Potter in \\\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\\" To the disappointment of gossip columnists around the world, the young actor says he has no plans to fritter his cash away on fast cars, drink and celebrity parties. \\\"I don't plan to be one of those people who, as soon as they turn 18, suddenly buy themselves a massive sports car collection or something similar,\\\" he told an Australian interviewer earlier this month. \\\"I don't think I'll be particularly extravagant. \\\"The things I like buying are things that cost about 10 pounds -- books and CDs and DVDs.\\\" At 18, Radcliffe will be able to gamble in a casino, buy a drink in a pub or see the horror film \\\"Hostel: Part II,\\\" currently six places below his number one movie on the UK box office chart. Details of how he'll mark his landmark birthday are under wraps. His agent and publicist had no comment on his plans. \\\"I'll definitely have some sort of party,\\\" he said in an interview. \\\"Hopefully none of you will be reading about it.\\\" Radcliffe's earnings from the first five Potter films have been held in a trust fund which he has not been able to touch. Despite his growing fame and riches, the actor says he is keeping his feet firmly on the ground. \\\"People are always looking to say 'kid star goes off the rails,'\\\" he told reporters last month. \\\"But I try very hard not to go that way because it would be too easy for them.\\\" His latest outing as the boy wizard in \\\"Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix\\\" is breaking records on both sides of the Atlantic and he will reprise the role in the last two films.  Watch I-Reporter give her review of Potter's latest \\u00bb . There is life beyond Potter, however. The Londoner has filmed a TV movie called \\\"My Boy Jack,\\\" about author Rudyard Kipling and his son, due for release later this year. He will also appear in \\\"December Boys,\\\" an Australian film about four boys who escape an orphanage. Earlier this year, he made his stage debut playing a tortured teenager in Peter Shaffer's \\\"Equus.\\\" Meanwhile, he is braced for even closer media scrutiny now that he's legally an adult: \\\"I just think I'm going to be more sort of fair game,\\\" he told Reuters.

Messi (left) is congratulated by Ronaldinho after scoring again in Barcelona's 3-0 win over Atletico Madrid. Barcelona had thumped Atletico 6-0 on their own ground last season and the visitors were out for revenge -- but conceded twice in four minutes. After 15 minutes, Italian goalkeeper Christian Abbiati let a routine Messi cross slip out of his hands and Deco rolled home into the empty net. Four minutes later Messi played a great one-two with Ronaldinho and rifled a shot past Abbiati for his sixth goal of the season and Xavi added a third late on. \\\"It was a deserved victory against a rival that we have had problems with in the past,\\\" explained Barca coach Frank Rijkaard. \\\"We scored twice in quick succession and then we controlled the match using aggression and with the team attacking and defending as a unit.\\\" \\\"Conceding two early goals inside four minutes is not easy to turn around especially against Barcelona,\\\" admitted Atletico coach Javier Aguirre. It was Barcelona's fourth straight league win but they still trail Real Madrid by two points after the champions beat Recreativo Huleva 2-0. Dutch international Ruud van Nistelrooy, the league's top-scorer last season, scored on 72 minutes before Gonzalo Higuain netted in the final minute to keep Real at the summit. Luck deserted them when Wesley Sneijder hit the post but Van Nistelrooy scored in the final quarter hour before Higuain struck to keep them two points clear at the top. Real have made their best start since 1991 but coach Bernd Schuster's rotation policy has been questioned with the German chopping and changing his team. \\\"It was an important victory because it is the final match before we go away on international duty,\\\" said Dutch winger Arjen Robben. \\\"We are now top for the next two weeks and can build on that when we return.\\\" Villarreal, now four points behind Real, lost for only the second time in 15 matches with a 3-2 reverse against Osasuna. Sevilla, third last season, are in a crisis after losing their fourth league game in a row with a goal from Riki handing Deportivo La Coruna a surprise 1-0 win. Sevilla have just six points from their first six matches and are 13 points behind Real. Levante's Abel Resino became the first Spanish league coach to be sacked this season, after their 3-0 home loss to Real Zaragoza. . The 47-year-old Resino, a former goalkeeper at Atletico Madrid, joined Levante in January as a replacement for Juan Ramon Lopez Caro. The Valencia-based club are bottom of the table with only a point from seven matches. E-mail to a friend .\",\n          \"(Real Simple) -- Here are five great ways to enjoy your summer. Lazing in a hammock is one of the best ways to spend a summer evening. Best way to cut jeans into shorts  -- What better way to declare the start of summer? The key to cutting off jeans is not to go too short too soon. Slip on the jeans and mark the desired length on one leg with chalk. \\\"Take them off, fold the leg at the mark, and iron the fold,\\\" says Caroline Calvin, creative director of Levi's. \\\"Then cut just under the crease with fabric scissors. Lay the short jean leg on top of the other side and cut to evenly match.\\\" Repeat as needed to get the length you want. Ninety-degree days? Bring 'em on! The best way to catch fireflies --  How? With womanly wiles: \\\"Fireflies blink to attract a mate,\\\" explains naturalist Lynn Havsall, director of programs at the George B. Dorr Museum of Natural History, in Bar Harbor, Maine. \\\"Males fly around while females sit in trees, in shrubs, or on the ground. So find a female and watch her blinking pattern. Then imitate the pattern with a pen flashlight and the males will come to you.\\\" ]A plus: The bugs move slowly, so they're easy to trap in a jar. Punch some holes in the lid and add a little grass and a piece of fruit for moisture. Admire your pretty night-lights till bedtime, then let them go. The best way to run on the beach -- Who needs a treadmill when you have miles of shoreline? Running on the beach can get you into great shape. Take it from lifeguard Benjamin Guss, 25, of Del Mar, California, who recently qualified to compete in this year's Iron Man triathlon (yes, that means swimming 2.4 miles, biking 112 miles, and then running a marathon -- consecutively) in Kailua-Kona, Hawaii. Beware, shoeless Joes. If you choose to run barefoot, keep your workouts brief at first to allow tender soles to build up calluses. \\\"You can get blisters, even burns, from hot, soft sand,\\\" says Guss. \\\"I like to run barefoot, but for more than a couple miles, I wear shoes.\\\" Know your sand. \\\"In soft sand, one mile is like two,\\\" says Guss. You may work foot and leg muscles you don't always use, so start slowly. And hard sand can be as tough on your legs as the road, so wear running sneakers. Pick the right time to run. \\\"My favorite time is in the evening,\\\" says Guss. \\\"The wind dies down, and the sand isn't that hot.\\\" To work harder, fill small bags with sand to use as hand weights. The best way to get in and out of a hammock -- Everyone looks good lazing in a hammock  -- it's getting in and out that's tricky. To make it less so, try these tips from Penny Waugh, a buyer for http://www.hammocks.com/. \\u2022 Position your backside toward the hammock's center and tilt back until you reach a 45-degree angle, with the hammock parallel to your rear. \\u2022 Gently sit back into the hammock and let it level out. \\u2022 Swing your legs up and stretch them out. \\u2022 Lie back. Loll. Sigh contentedly. For a graceful exit, sit upright and swing your legs off, anchoring your feet on the ground. Then push with your behind, gathering momentum to stand. \\\"It's tricky, since there's nothing to hold on to,\\\" says Waugh. \\\"But it's good for the glutes.\\\" The best way to tie espadrilles -- Apply this lace-up logic from Meghan Cleary, author of \\\"The Perfect Fit: What Your Shoes Say About You.\\\" \\u2022 Slide your foot fully into the shoe and plant it firmly on the floor. \\u2022 Cross and tie the laces once behind the ankle, then bring them forward, cross and tie again, and continue up the leg, depending on how long the laces are. The calf is the maximum height -- any higher and you'll look like a gladiator. \\u2022 Each time you cross and tie, secure the laces slightly tighter than is comfortable, since they will loosen a bit when you walk. Just don't cut off your circulation. \\u2022 For a streamlined leg, make the final tie in the back. Create a more whimsical look by putting the final tie in front with a small bow.

An image from a video posted on YouTube by \\\"Sturmgeist89.\\\" The shooting appeared to have been planned out in graphic videos posted on Internet file-sharing site YouTube. At a news conference this afternoon, police confirmed the dead numbered two girls, five boys and the school's headmistress at Jokela High in Tuusula, a quiet town around 50 kilometers (30 miles) north of Helsinki. Ten other people were taken to a hospital with minor injuries. The shooter, whom police identified as Pekka Eric Auvinen, died at Toolo Hospital, authorities said. Police said he took his own life. It was the first school shooting in Finland since 1989, when a 14-year-old student shot and killed two others in the coastal town of Rauma, the Finnish news agency STT reported. Police said Auvinen is from Tuusula and who acted alone. He had no previous criminal record and had never threatened anyone from the school before, they added. Auvinen published a manifesto online demanding war on the \\\"weak-minded masses\\\" and pledged to die for his cause.  Watch Auvinen fire weapons in video from his Web page \\u00bb . YouTube appeared to have removed 89 videos linked to his account, many of them featuring Nazi imagery, shortly after the incident. Finnish media reported someone posted a message two weeks ago on the Web site, warning of a bloodbath at the school. A video posted earlier Wednesday, by \\\"Sturmgeist89,\\\" was titled \\\"Jokela High School Massacre - 11/7/2007.\\\" \\\"Sturmgeist89\\\" identified himself as Auvinen, and said he chose the name \\\"Sturmgeist\\\" because it means \\\"storm spirit\\\" in German. The video showed a picture of the school, which then disintegrated to reveal two images of Auvinen against a red background, pointing a gun at the screen. The clip is accompanied by the song \\\"Stray Bullet\\\" from rock band KMFDM. Eric Harris and Dylan Klebold, the students behind the 1999 Columbine High School massacre, also cited that group's lyrics. Another short video clip, called \\\"Just Testing My Gun,\\\" showed Auvinen loading and cocking a handgun. He fired and hit several pieces of fruit in a wooded area; the camera then showed a close-up of the destroyed fruit, and then a full-screen shot of him again. He waved at the camera and then walked out of view. The site indicated that the youth appeared to be fascinated with killing. As well as video footage of the Columbine school shootings, it also included clips of the 1993 Waco siege in the United States, the 1995 sarin gas attack in Tokyo, and bombs falling on Baghdad during the 2003 invasion. Many showed victims being wheeled away or people running for their lives. Throughout all of this, the single word \\\"DIE\\\" constantly flashed across the screen. Other video clips included Nazi-war-criminal footage. In the rambling text posted on the site, Auvinen said that he is \\\"a cynical existentialist, anti-human humanist, anti-social social-Darwinist, realistic idealist and god-like atheist. \\\"I am prepared to fight and die for my cause,\\\" he wrote. \\\"I, as a natural selector, will eliminate all who I see unfit, disgraces of human race and failures of natural selection.\\\" The police said at this afternoon's press conference that they had been fired at when they arrived at the school at 11.45 p.m. local time (9.45 a.m. GMT). They described the scene as chaotic, with some of the 460 students, ranging in age from 12 to 18, breaking windows in an attempt to escape. When the police's special SWAT unit entered the high school they found the gunman unconscious and in critical condition in the lower lobby of the building with a gunshot wound to his head. Police assume he tried to take his own life as no officers fired at him.  Several bodies were also found in the same location, where the shooting is believed to have begun, they added. They could not confirm comments by some students that Auvinen was firing through doors. Police also said that the gun Auvinen used, which was fully licensed, had been purchased less than a month ago on October 19. The legal age limit to own a gun in Finland is 18, which Auvinen passed in June of this year. He had a recommendation from a shooting club when he obtained the gun, police added, and practised sharp-shooting as a hobby at a shooting range. Finland, which enjoys a strong tradition of hunting, has a high proportion of gun ownership, with two million firearms owned in a nation of only five million. The Associated Press reported comments from Kim Kiuru, one of the school's teachers, on radio station YLE. Kiuru described how the headmistress used the public address system around noon to tell pupils to stay in classrooms. He said he locked his classroom door, then waited in the corridor for more news. \\\"After that I saw the gunman running with what appeared to be a small-caliber handgun in his hand through the doors towards me, after which I escaped to the corridor downstairs and ran in the opposite direction, \\\" Kiuru said. The agency reported Kiuru as saying that he saw a woman's body as he fled the school, before telling his pupils to leave the building through the windows.  E-mail to a friend . Copyright 2007 CNN.

Nous avons pu constater que la génération automatique de résumés par un modèle comme T5-small est globalement correcte, mais dépend fortement du modèle utilisé et du type de texte. Les scores ROUGE nous offrent une mesure objective mais partielle de qualité, notamment sur la couverture et la fidélité du résumé. Ce type d’évaluation est essentiel pour affiner les choix de modèle dans des applications de production (médias, recherche, veille, etc.)."
