        "In this example, we'll fine-tune a base ViT model with two different datasets using LoRA. Then, we'll load the base model and dynamically swap both LoRA adapters depending on the task we want to complete.\n",

        "## Why does this matter?\n",
        "\n",
        "A foundation model knows how to do many things, but it's not great at many tasks. We can fine-tune the model to produce specialized models that are very good at solving specific tasks.\n",
        "\n",
        "We'll use LoRA to fine-tune the foundation model and generate many, specialized adapters. We can load these adapters together with a model to dynamically transform its capabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "When loading the model, we'll take the foundation model's original weights and apply the LoRA weight changes to it to get the fine-tuned model weights.\n",
        "\n",
        "The beauty of LoRA is that we don't need to fine-tune the entire matrix of weights. Instead, we can get away by fine-tuning two matrices of lower rank. These matrices, when multiplied together, will get us the weight updates we'll need to apply the foundation model to modify its capabilities.\n"

        "- `accelerate` : a thin wrapper to simplify multi-GPU/multi-node training and mixed-precision. It allows us to launch our model in one line `accelerate launch train.py`. We use it to scale training from a single GPU to many GPUs with minimal code changes.\n",

LoRA is one of the core PEFT methods. We use this library to adapt huge models on your data without full fine-tuning, reducing memory & compute costs.\n"
